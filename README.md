# Mixology

Mixology is a Vue successor to my React app [Eat The Rainbow](https://github.com/nicolesmithdev/eat-the-rainbow). This app houses my own tried and true cocktail recipes, allowing me to filter by ingredients I have on hand to see which drinks I can craft.

## How to Use

This app is deployed to GitHub pages and can be found here: https://nicolesmithdev.github.io/mixology/
